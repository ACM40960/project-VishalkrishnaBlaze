### Hyperparameters Evaluation

The Poisson distribution simulates football matches via MCMC due to its fit for modeling event counts i.e., goals scored. The derived Poisson regression model effectively captures this pattern. The goal distribution graph supports its relevance, confirming its role in football match simulation.

<div style="background-color: white; display: inline-block; padding: 10px;">
    <img width="734" alt="Poisson distribution" src="https://github.com/ACM40960/project-shubidiwoop/blob/main/assets/goal_poisson.svg">
   <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 1: Graph illustrating the alignment of the Poisson distribution model with observed goal distribution in football matches.</em></p> 
</div>

- Train-test split point: For each `k`, the code trains the forecasting model using historical data and calculates the MAE for predicting future observations. The average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is computed for home and away teams separately for different values of training set sizes. The code identifies the `k` value corresponding to the lowest average MAE through the plot, which can be considered as the optimal training set size for the forecasting task. Optimal k figured is around 228 (out of 380 matches played in a season)

<div style="background-color: white; display: inline-block; padding: 10px;">
    <img width="734" alt="k_ideal" src="https://github.com/ACM40960/project-shubidiwoop/blob/main/assets/average_mae_plot.svg">
   <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 2: Scatter plot depicting the relationship between the parameter k and the average Mean Absolute Error (Avg_MAE= home and away average)</em></p> 
</div>
  
- Home Ground Advantage: The football data analysis shows home teams have an edge which may be due to factors like fan support and familiarity with their ground. This leads to an extra parameter (home ground advantage) in the Poisson regression model. The graph based on the 22-23 season confirms higher goal scoring for home teams. This parameter enhances realism, reducing differences between simulated and actual outcomes, measured by Mean Squared Error (MSE). This comes to around 0.45.

```R
  # Calculate lambdaa and lambdab with home advantage
     lambdaa <- exp(parameters$teams[a, "Attack"] - parameters$teams[b, "Defence"] + home_advantage)
     lambdab <- exp(parameters$teams[b, "Attack"] - parameters$teams[a, "Defence"])
```

### Project Workflow

1. Optimal split value derived from MAE.
2. Simulate EPL table using various approaches: 
  - GLM and Poisson-based Monte Carlo: Utilize Poisson regression through R's 'glm' function to simulate standings, calculating attack, defense strengths, and home advantage. 
  - Manual team data reduction for strengths: Compute strength based on average goals, ignoring nuances like opponent quality. 
  - PCA for team strength and table prediction: PCA captures key statistics using two components, representing over 95% variability, and integrates home advantage. Determine home advantage through cross-validation
  - Factor Analysis gave inconclusive results due to inconducive data dimensions.
3. Procrustes Algorithm compares non-metric MDS values from models.
4. Choose best model and predict odds/probabilities.
5. Compare predicted odds with actual organization-provided odds.
6. Translate odds to monetary terms, ensuring the house profits.

### Machine Learning Algorithms

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used in machine learning to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much variance as possible. In the project, PCA has been used to extract meaningful features such as the team strengths, incorporating the home team advantage, from sports statistics data. This has in turn been used to simulate the league standings, and the odds for a team to win a game. It can be seen that the first two principal components reflect more than 95% variability in the data. 

```R
team_data <- as.data.frame(t(Table285[, c("HF", "HA", "AF", "AA")]))# Standardize the data before performing PCA
# Perform PCA
pca_result <- prcomp(scale(team_data), center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)
```

- Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) can play a significant role in this project by offering a versatile framework for predicting sports outcomes based on various factors. GLMs extend linear regression to accommodate non-normally distributed response variables, making them suitable for modeling binary outcomes like win/loss in sports. In the context of sports statistics, a GLM can be tailored to estimate the probabilities of different match outcomes by considering input features such as team strengths, home advantage, and previous performance. By applying appropriate link functions and distribution assumptions, GLMs can generate outcome probabilities and simulate league standings. Comparing the predicted standings with actual outcomes allows evaluation of the model's performance, aiding in the selection of the most effective predictive method.

```R
  parameters <- glm(formula = Y ~ 0 + XX, family = poisson)
# In the parameters function
```

- In addition, the project incorporates manual functions and the Poisson distribution to compute critical factors such as attack and defense strengths, along with the home advantage for each team. By analyzing historical data, these functions assess the average goals scored and conceded by each team. The attack strength is derived from the difference between average goals scored and conceded, while defense strength stems from the contrary difference. These calculated strengths form the basis for predicting match outcomes using the Poisson distribution. The Î» (lambda) parameters, representing expected goal counts, are adjusted to include the home advantage, further enhancing the model's predictive accuracy.
  
```R
# Calculate Attack and Defence Strength for each team
team_data$Attack <- sapply(team_data$Team, function(team) {
  # Calculate average goals scored and conceded for the team
  avg_goals_scored <- mean(c(data_subset$FTHG[data_subset$HomeTeam == team], data_subset$FTAG[data_subset$AwayTeam == team]))
  avg_goals_conceded <- mean(c(data_subset$FTAG[data_subset$HomeTeam == team], data_subset$FTHG[data_subset$AwayTeam == team]))
  return(avg_goals_scored - avg_goals_conceded)
})
team_data$Defence <- sapply(team_data$Team, function(team) {
  # Calculate average goals scored and conceded for the team
  avg_goals_scored <- mean(c(data_subset$FTHG[data_subset$HomeTeam == team], data_subset$FTAG[data_subset$AwayTeam == team]))
  avg_goals_conceded <- mean(c(data_subset$FTAG[data_subset$HomeTeam == team], data_subset$FTHG[data_subset$AwayTeam == team]))
  return(avg_goals_conceded - avg_goals_scored)
})
```

- In addition to Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the project also employs Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) for visualizing teams in a 2D space while preserving their relative ranks. MDS is a technique that aims to represent high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space, often for visualization purposes. Non-Metric MDS is utilized to map team data into a 2D space, allowing for an intuitive visualization of team relationships. This technique retains the relative differences between teams while projecting them onto a 2D plane, providing insights into team clusters, similarities, and disparities.
  
```R
# Non-Metric MDS for 2D visualization
library(MASS)
loc = isoMDS(dist(SimTable_actual), k=2, eig=TRUE)
```

### Results

- The project utilizes Procrustes analysis to compare the results obtained from different models. Procrustes analysis is a technique that aligns two sets of data points to best match their structures. In the context of this project, Procrustes analysis is used to align the MDS representations of different models, enabling a quantitative comparison of their predictions and visualizations in the 2D space. The scatter plot below visualizes the results of a Procrustes analysis performed on two sets of Non-metric Multidimensional scaled data of the actual standing and pca standing table. The blue points correspond to the aligned data points from the "Actual" set, while the red dashed line indicates the 1:1 reference line, highlighting how well the alignment matches the original data.

```R
procrustes(loc$points, loc2$points)
```

- Furthemore, MAE and MAPE has been employed to compare the different models. MAE calculates the average absolute difference between each team's position in the actual standings and the corresponding position in the simulated standings. This metric provides an overall measure of positional accuracy. Furthermore, MAPE calculates the average percentage difference between each team's position in the actual standings and the corresponding position in the simulated standings. This metric provides insights into the relative accuracy of positional predictions.

- Based on the results table, GLM has been identified as the preferred method to pursue further investigation and development in odds and betting.

### Betting Insights

- Discuss how the betting insights are generated by comparing predicted outcomes with real-time odds.
  The Monte Carlo simulation approach is employed to calculate probabilities for different outcomes (HomeWin, Draw, AwayWin) for various match outcomes between teams, and set into a dataframe. This display acts as a preliminary assessment of the model's accuracy and is particularly useful for gaining insights into its strengths and areas of improvement at a glance.

- The dataframe is then merged with additional home, draw and away winning odds data obtained from betting organizations, like B365H and IW. All these odds are then scaled/standardized, to bring the predicted probabilities and real-time odds to a common scale for accurate correlation calculations. Then correlation coefficients are calculated to quantify the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the predicted probabilities and the real-time odds (by Bet365 and IW) for different outcomes (HomeWin, Draw, AwayWin). 

- Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient is useful to compare the two columns as their relationship follows a monotonic pattern, enabling assessment of non-linear connections and ordinal data comparisons. The presented results below indicate a positive correlation (0.8) between our predicted odds and the actual odds, suggesting a favorable alignment between our predictive model and the real-time odds.


| No. | Comparison        | Correlation |
|----:|-------------------|------------:|
|   1 | Bet365 vs Homewin |     0.8109 |
|   2 | Bet365 vs Awaywin |     0.8465 |
|   3 | Average Bet365    |     0.8287 |
|   4 | IW vs Homewin     |     0.8032 |
|   5 | IW vs Awaywin     |     0.8463 |
|   6 | Average IW        |     0.8247 |
  
- Ensuring house profits:

To achieve this, a simulation-based approach is used to analyze the potential earnings and outcomes of a betting strategy applied to football match results. A function is used that generates simulated betting outcomes based on given odds and a specified number of bets. It adds randomness from both normal and uniform distributions to the initial bets and calculates the resulting betting values and the total earnings, which are made to be exponential to the number of bets made. As seen from the plot below, the total house earnings increase as the number of bets made increases.

<div style="background-color: white; display: inline-block; padding: 10px;">

   <p><em>Figure 7: Relationship between the number of bets per match and total house earnings.</em></p>
</div>

### Future Prospects

The current simulation-based approach, inspired by the project, holds exciting prospects for future applications. It can be extended to different sports leagues, seasons, and even esports. Enhancements can involve integrating real-time data for a more realistic house earnings model and comparing a variety of machine learning models like Random Forests and Neural Networks for improved predictions. This expansion could greatly amplify the methodology's versatility, accuracy, and relevance for sports analytics and the betting industry.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, this project demonstrates a holistic approach that combines advanced statistical modeling, machine learning techniques, and real-time odds comparison to accurately predict sports outcomes, enabling informed betting decisions while ensuring the sustainability of house profits, which can be replicated across various sports leagues and seasons.
